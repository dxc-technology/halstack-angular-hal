# ⚠️ Halstack Angular Hal - Discontinuation Notice ⚠️

Dear Community,

We have decided to discontinue active maintenance and development of Halstack Angular Hal project .

**Key Points:**

1. **No Further Updates:**
   - we will no longer actively maintain or release new versions of Halstack Angular. This decision is based on various factors, including shifts in project priorities and resource allocation.

2. **GitHub Repository:**
   - The GitHub repository will remain accessible. While we won't actively address issues or pull requests, you are welcome to fork the project and continue its development independently.

3. **No New npm Versions:**
   - We will not be publishing any new versions of halstack-angular-hal on npm. Existing versions will still be available for use in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dxc-technology/halstack-angular-hal).

4. **Thank You:**
   - We want to express our gratitude for the support and contributions from the Halstack Angular community. Your involvement has been invaluable, and we appreciate the journey we've shared.

- **Archived Status:**
  - We will eventually archive the GitHub repository to signify its inactive status. This is a standard practice for projects that are no longer actively maintained.



Once again, thank you for being a part of the Halstack Angular community. We appreciate your understanding, and we look forward to the continued success of projects built upon the foundation of Halstack.

# Halstack HAL Angular Components

Halstack HAL angular Components is an npm library of reusable Angular components. It brings together two different responsibilities:

- Consuming Hal REST API's implementing following the [DXC API Guidelines](https://developer.dxc.com/apis)

- Rendering these API resources as UI components that are compliant with the [DXC UX Guidelines](https://developer.dxc.com/design/principles)

We have other libraries that will help you handling these responsibilities individually ([Halstack Client](https://github.com/dxc-technology/dxc-halstack-client) / [Halstack Angular CDK](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-angular/) ). Halstack HAL Angular Components uses them under the hood, but it's a higher level abstraction that puts both responsibilities together using the most common association patterns.

For example, collection resources are often associated with tables, and there are a lot of semantics in the standards described by the DXC API guidelines for collections (sorting, paginating...) that could be associated with UI interactions (clicking a table header for sorting, clicking pages for paginating)

## Usage

Halstack HAL Angular Components is distributed as an npm library. In order to use it in an existing project, you must install it first:

```
npm install @dxc-technology/halstack-angular-hal
```

The library provides the following components and functions to be used in your Angular application:

Components

- [HAL Autocomplete](#HalAutocompleteComponent)

- [HAL Table](#HalTableComponent)

Service Facade

- [HAL Resource Service](#halresource-service)

## HAL Autocomplete Component

### HAL Autocomplete Usage

```TS
import { DxcAutocompleteHalModule, DxcAutocompleteHalComponent } from '@dxc-technology/halstack-angular-hal';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    DxcAutocompleteHalComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    DxcAutocompleteHalModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  entryComponents: []

```

### HAL Table Directives

Directives are used to add functionality and new syntax into HTML components. The following directives are customized and you can use them on this component.

| Name                           | Default                                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### HAL Table Example

#### HTML file

As you know, angular provides a view component which is more o less similar to dom element.
In this view component, angular provides a container element and in this hal table component is
going to be defined inside as a column of the dxc hal table.
These columns has the property name defined in the dxcColumnDef directive in the ng-container component.

Inside of each column container, in a td html element has to be defined the element variable to reach the item value of a hal resource element as it's seen in the next example \*dxcCellDef="let item".

```html
<dxc-hal-table halUrl="http://..." headers="" itemsPerPage="4">
  <ng-container
    dxcColumnDef="User"
    [sortable]="{ isSortable: true, propertyName: 'prospect-full-name' }"
  >
    <td *dxcCellDef="let item">
      <dxc-button [label]="item['prospect-full-name']"> </dxc-button>
    </td>
  </ng-container>

  <ng-container
    dxcColumnDef="Date"
    [sortable]="{ isSortable: true, propertyName: 'prospect-update-date' }"
  >
    <td *dxcCellDef="let element">
      <dxc-tag [label]="element['prospect-update-date']"> </dxc-tag>
    </td>
  </ng-container>

  <ng-container dxcColumnDef="Email">
    <td *dxcCellDef="let element">{{ element["prospect-distributor-id"] }}</td>
  </ng-container>
</dxc-hal-table>
```

```

### HAL Resource Service Parameters

| Name                    | Default | Description                                                                                                         |

Before opening new issues or pull requests, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.MD](https://github.com/dxc-technology/halstack-angular-hal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development Setup

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

The project is divided in two main folders. One is for the actual library, and the other is an Angular application using the library.

### Library

Contained in the `diaas-angular-cdk-hal` folder.

```bash
cd projects\diaas-angular-cdk-hal
```

Install the library dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Run the build process into `dist` folder, detecting and automatically building changes in src.

```bash
npm run build-lib:watch
```

Or if there is no need to watch for changes, run the build process and pack it to generate the library.

```bash
npm run generate-lib
```

### Example Application

Contained in the `cdk-hal-examples` folder, but it can be run from the root of the repository.

```bash
cd halstack-angular-hal
```

Install the application dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

The Halstack HAL Angular CDK needs to be linked to the application (from the folder `dist\diaas-angular-cdk-hal`). This one must have been previously built as shown before.

```bash
npm run link-lib
```

Start the application.

```bash
npm run start
```

To be able to see data on these components, a server should be run. It is used [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) for this purpose so it must be installed.

Once it is done, go to `db` folder and execute the server.

```bash
cd db
node server.js
```

If you are watching for changes, anytime you make a change to the library or the app, `angular cli` will live-reload your local dev server so you can iterate on your component in real-time.

## Running the tests
Run tests from the library folder `projects\diaas-angular-cdk-hal` after the library dependencies have been installed.

```bash
cd projects\diaas-angular-cdk-hal
npm run test
```
